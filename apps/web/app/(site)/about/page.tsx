      <p>
        I’m an engineer and integrator helping teams ship agent systems that work in
        production. My focus: Agent‑to‑Agent (A2A) transports, Model Context Protocol (MCP)
        tooling, and the glue that turns demos into dependable workflows.
      </p>
      <p>
        Previously I’ve built data and platform capabilities across startups and consulting,
        with a bias for small, testable steps and measurable outcomes.
